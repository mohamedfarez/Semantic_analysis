Semantic Analysis with NLP
This project involves the implementation of a semantic analysis system using natural language processing techniques. The notebook Semantic_analysis.ipynb provides an in-depth guide to the processes involved, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Project Structure
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Steps to load and clean the dataset, including tokenization, stemming, and other preprocessing techniques.
Feature Extraction: Methods used for extracting features from the text, such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, or other techniques.
Model Training: Overview of the models trained for semantic analysis, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or other tasks.
Model Evaluation: How the models were evaluated, including metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Any visualizations used to represent model performance or data insights.
Getting Started
Requirements:

Python 3.x
Required libraries (e.g., nltk, scikit-learn, gensim, spaCy, matplotlib, etc.)
Installation:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Notebook:
Open the notebook Semantic_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter and run the cells to execute the code and observe the results.

Optimization and Further Work
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Model Exploration: Explore different models or techniques to improve the results.
Data Augmentation: Consider using more data or different datasets to improve the robustness of the models.
Advanced Techniques: Implement more sophisticated models like transformer-based architectures for better semantic understanding.
Results and Evaluation
Include a summary of the results obtained from the analysis, along with any significant findings or conclusions drawn from the study.
